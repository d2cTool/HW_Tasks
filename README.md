# HW_Tasks

## Task 1


## Task 2
### Objective: 
• understand delegate usage scenarios; 
• understand the relationship delegates versus interfaces; 
• understand callback functions; 
• study design pattern Strategy 
• study design pattern Observer; 
• understand difference between events and delegates; 
• understand DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), SoC (Separation of Concerns principles), Low Coupling principles; 
• understand standard event delegate pattern. 
### Tasks 
1. Create a console application. 
2. Create a class, which allows to bubble-sort a matrix of integers (do not use System.Array methods) in order to arrange matrix rows: 
• in ascending (descending) order of sums of matrix row elements 
• in ascending (descending) order of maximum element in a matrix row; 
• in ascending (descending) order of minimum element in a matrix row; 
• USE DELEGATES with STRATEGY PATTERN (comparison type and order type should be passed by user. You can hardcode demo-matrix) 
4. Develop a Countdown class, which implements the capability to transmit a message to any subscriber who subscribes to the event after the appointed time (waiting time is provided by the user). You can use the Thread.SleepO method to create a wait effect. Provide the possibility of subscribing to an event in several classes.
