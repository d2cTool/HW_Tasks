# HW_Tasks

## Task 1
1. Create a class library 
2. Implement a BinarySearch generic method (do not use the type constraints). 
3. Implement a method for the counting of the Fibonacci's numbers of the Fibonacci using the iterator block yield. 
4. Develop a generic class-collection Queue that implements the basic operations for working with the stucture data queue. Implement the capability to iterate by collection by design pattern Iterator. 
5. Develop a generic class-collection Stack that implements the basic operations for working with the stucture data stack. Implement the capability to iterate by collection by design pattern Iterator. 
6. Develop a generic class-collection Set that implements the basic operations for working with the stucture data set with the reference types elements. Implement the capability to iterate by collection by block iterator yield. 
7. Creata a console application which demonstrates the fucntionality of the class library. 
8. Create anothed console application. 
9. Implement a calculator which evaluates expressions in Reverse Polish notation. For example, expression 5 1 2 + 4 * + 3 -(which is equivalent to 5 + ((1 + 2) * 4) - 3 in normal notation) should evaluate to 14. Note, that for simplicity you may assume that there are always spaces between numbers and operations, e.g. 1 3 + expression is valid, but 1 3+ isn't. Empty expression should evaluate to O. Valid operations are +, -, *, /. 

## Task 2
### Objective: 
• understand delegate usage scenarios; 
• understand the relationship delegates versus interfaces; 
• understand callback functions; 
• study design pattern Strategy 
• study design pattern Observer; 
• understand difference between events and delegates; 
• understand DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), SoC (Separation of Concerns principles), Low Coupling principles; 
• understand standard event delegate pattern. 
### Tasks 
1. Create a console application. 
2. Create a class, which allows to bubble-sort a matrix of integers (do not use System.Array methods) in order to arrange matrix rows: 
• in ascending (descending) order of sums of matrix row elements 
• in ascending (descending) order of maximum element in a matrix row; 
• in ascending (descending) order of minimum element in a matrix row; 
• USE DELEGATES with STRATEGY PATTERN (comparison type and order type should be passed by user. You can hardcode demo-matrix) 
4. Develop a Countdown class, which implements the capability to transmit a message to any subscriber who subscribes to the event after the appointed time (waiting time is provided by the user). You can use the Thread.SleepO method to create a wait effect. Provide the possibility of subscribing to an event in several classes.
